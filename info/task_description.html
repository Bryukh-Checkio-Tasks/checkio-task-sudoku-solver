<p>
    Decrypt a string to discover the hidden message
</p>


<p><i>
    Your program must be able to take in any string as input.
    If the string has an even number of characters, start with the first and last character, 
    then second and second to last character, moving inwards, take their ascii values, convert 
    them to base 2 and do <em>XOR</em> on the last 6 binary numbers of each pair. The rest of the numbers are 
    <em>AND</em>ed together. If there is an odd number of characters, then the middle letter will have its 
    last 6 characters <em>inverted</em> (all 1s to 0s and all 0s to 1). Then these numbers will be converted 
    back to their base 10 ascii characters and output the message in the order of outside to inside.</i></p>
